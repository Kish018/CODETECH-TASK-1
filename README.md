### Overview of the Project

### Project : Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Iris Dataset

### Objective

The objective of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) trends, distributions, correlations, and outliers through visualizations. dataset containing Iris data collection of length, width and species of petals and sepals in centimeters.
Start with a dataset of your choice and perform EDA using libraries like pandas, numpy, and matplotlib or seaborn. Explore the data's characteristics, distributions, correlations, and outliers. Visualize your findings with histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps to gain insights into the data.

### Key Activities

**Data Cleaning:** Ensuring the dataset is free from Inconsistencies and missing values.

**Data Visualization:** Creating visualizations to understand data distributions, trends, and relationships.

**Correlation Analysis:** Identifying correlations between population figures across different years.

### Technologies Used

**Python:** The primary programming language for data analysis.

**pandas:** Used for data manipulation and analysis.

**matplotlib:** Employed for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.

**seaborn:** Utilized for making statistical graphics that Inforsative and attractive
